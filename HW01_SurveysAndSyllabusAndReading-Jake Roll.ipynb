Unexcused absence results in zero points for the day, including the in-class assignment points.  arriving late or leaving early also results in a zero.  Legitimate reasons to miss class must be arranged ahead of time. Three unexcused absences will reduce your grade by one step (ex. 4.0 to 3.5).  ICA's cannot be submitted if absent from class.  No late assignments accepted for ICA's, Homework assignments are accepted for a late grade up to 48 hours after the due date.  10% penalty if submitted within 24 hours of the deadline, 20% penalty if submitted within 24-48 hours after the deadline.**"
